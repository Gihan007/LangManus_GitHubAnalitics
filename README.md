# LangManus GitHub Repo Analyzer

**LangManus** is an open-source tool for automated analysis of GitHub repositories. It provides valuable insights into commit activity, trends, and contributions. By leveraging multiple **vertical** and **horizontal agents**, LangManus performs tasks such as scraping commit data, categorizing commits, generating charts, and producing detailed Markdown reports. It‚Äôs designed to help developers, project managers, and teams make data-driven decisions based on real-time repository analysis.

## Features

* **Trending Repo Finder**: Automatically identifies trending repositories on GitHub for analysis.
* **Commit Data Scraping**: Scrapes commit history, author information, and commit details from GitHub.
* **Commit Categorization**: Categorizes commits into specific types like bug fixes, features, updates, and documentation.
* **Data Visualization**: Generates charts for commit activity, commit types, and word frequencies.
* **Markdown Report Generation**: Outputs a well-structured Markdown report summarizing the analysis and charts.
* **Open-Source**: Fully open-source, allowing you to contribute and customize according to your needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* Python 3.x
* Git
* An IDE or text editor of your choice
* **GitHub API Token** for authentication (more on this in the setup section)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up LangManus on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langmanus.git
   cd langmanus
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment and install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your GitHub Token**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your **GitHub token**:

   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   ```

   You can generate a GitHub personal access token from [GitHub's Token Generation Page](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

## How to Use

LangManus works by sequentially running a series of agents to scrape data, analyze it, and generate a report. Here's how to run it:

1. **Run the LangManus Agent**:
   In your terminal, execute the following to start the analysis process:

   ```bash
   python streamlit_app.py
   ```

   This will launch a Streamlit interface that allows you to run the analysis on a **trending GitHub repository**.

2. **Start the analysis**:

   * Once the app is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.
   * Click the **"üîç Run Analysis on Trending Repo"** button.
   * LangManus will automatically find a trending repository, scrape commit activity, analyze it, and generate a report.

3. **Review the results**:
   After running the analysis, the app will display the following:

   * **Markdown Report**: A summary of the recent commits, categorized by type (bug fixes, features, etc.), along with detailed insights.
   * **Charts**: Visualizations such as:

     * **Commits per Day**: A time-series chart of commit frequency.
     * **Commits by Category**: A bar chart of commit types (bug fixes, features, etc.).
     * **Most Mentioned Topics**: A word frequency analysis of commit messages.

## Agents in LangManus

LangManus operates using a series of agents:

1. **Researcher Agent**: Identifies trending repositories on GitHub.
2. **Browser Agent**: Scrapes commit activity and repository metadata from GitHub.
3. **Coder Agent**: Analyzes commit data, categorizes commits, and generates visualizations.
4. **Reporter Agent**: Compiles the data analysis and visualizations into a Markdown report.

Each agent performs a specific task, and their operations are coordinated by the **LangManusAgent**, which manages the workflow and orchestrates the entire process.

## Customizing LangManus

Since **LangManus** is open-source, you can customize and extend it to suit your needs. Here are some common customization tasks:

* **Changing the Commit Analysis Window**: Modify the number of commits scraped by editing the `scrape_github_activity()` function in `agents/browser.py`.
* **Adding New Commit Categories**: Add new categories by modifying the `categorize_commit()` function in `agents/coder.py`.
* **New Data Sources**: LangManus currently works with GitHub. You can extend it to scrape data from other Git repositories like GitLab or Bitbucket by adjusting the scraping logic.
